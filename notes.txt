everything in javascript happens inside a global execution context   

Javascript is a synchronous and single threaded language.It means JS can execute only one command at a time

execution context is divided into two parts/phases:-
1)memory component/variable environment-> In this phase javascript engine go scan the code and only declare(allocate memory) variables with value=undefined and function with value=whole function.Data/Functions are stored in key value pairs.
2)thread of execution-> In this whole code is executed line by line and variables are intialised value ,functions are called,etc.

Function Invocation:-
Whenever a new function in executed then brand new execution context is created and we again go through the two phases of execution context.
In variable environment parameters and variables will declared with value equal to undefined and then next in thread of execution first of all parameters declared are intialised with value passed to function as argument and then similarly all other variables are initialised value if given and execute function in it.

Call Stack:-
In order handle creation,managment,deletion of execution context.
Global execution context is always at the bottom of stack and other context are pushed into the stack and when they are executed they are popped off

When we try to access and log variables and functions before even declaring them it does not throw error rather it logs undefined in the console.
Now this happens because in variable environment phase all variables are declared with undefined and functions are declared with whole function.
Now if we try to access a function created through arrow function and variable then it throws as it is treated as variable and undefined is stored in it and hence it throws that given variable is not a function.
for eg:-
 var getname=()=>{
     console.log("hello world!");
}
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variables and function declarations are automatically moved to the top of their scope. In other words, regardless of where a variable or function is declared in the code, it is treated as if it was declared at the top of the code block.

Whenever javascript program is executed even with empty js file it js engine creates window object(with some methods and properties) and this keyword.So when you create a variable or function it is added to this window object.
suppose you create a variable x and try to log it on console then you have to do like console.log(window.x) but if you do console.log(x) it will still log x to console cause if you does not provide any object(window object) then it will assume u are pointing to window object

difference between undefined and not defined:-
an variable is undefined if it was allocated placeholder or memory in variable environment and in code it was tried to access its value which is not yet intialised.
an variable is not defined if it was not allocated placeholder or memory during variable environment and hence engine cannot find the the variable in the global space

lexical environment is created Whenever an execution context is created(variable environment) and lexical environment is local memory + reference to lexical environment of parent

Hoisting is also done in let and const variable but we cannot access them before they are intialised
Temporal dead zone is the time between since when variable was hoisted till it was intialised

Reference Error:-JS Engine tried to find a variable but was unable to find it
Syntax Error:-This is error is show if the syntax is wrong for eg:- redeclaring same variabel twice
Type Error:-It is a error thrown for particular type(data type) for eg:- you try to re-intialise the variable intialised with const

Block:-lines of code within a curly braces represent a Block.They are used to represent a multiple lines of code as single line where js engine expects a single statement
for eg:- a if statement expects single statement after the condition
that is following code is absolute fine
if(true)console.log('single line') 
but we want to do more than one things so we use blocks
if(true){
    console.log('first line');
    console.log('second line');
} 

Block Scope:- what all variable and functions that can be accessed within the block

Shadowing:-If we have same named variable outside a particular block then variable inside the block shadows the variable outside the block
for eg:-
let b=1;
{
    let b=2;
    console.log(b)//prints 2 to the console
}
console.log(b)//prints 1 to the console

closure:-function along with its lexical scope forms a closure
Closure :Function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure. Whenever function is returned, even if its vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was pointing to
WHEN FUNCTIONS ARE RETURNED THEY STILL MAINTAIN THERE LEXICAL SCOPE,THEY REMEMBER WERE THEY WERE PRESENT

Event Loop has only one job that is continously monitor call stack and callback queue and microtask queue
callback functions from promises and mutation observer come in microtask queue


##Updating objects immutably in react
Even though you updated the object A with the statement A={...A,work:'student'}, you are not actually modifying the original A object. Instead, you are creating a new object that is a copy of the original object A with the additional property work set to 'student'.
This new object is a different object in memory, and the original object A is left untouched. This is the essence of immutability: you create a new object each time you update a state, rather than modifying the existing one. This helps avoid unintentional side effects that could arise if you modify an object directly.
 the original object A is not removed from memory. When you do A = { ...A, work: 'student' }, a new object is created with the properties of the old A object along with a new property work having the value 'student'. The new object is then assigned to the variable A. The old object A still exists in memory until it is no longer referenced anywhere in the code and the garbage collector removes it.
The important thing to note here is that the old object A has not been mutated. Instead, a new object has been created with the updated properties. This is what is meant by "updating objects immutably".
