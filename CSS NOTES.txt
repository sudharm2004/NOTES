INPUT BOX HAS SOME DEFAULT BORDER(1.6) AND PADDING(2).
SO WHEN YOU MAKE INPUT'S WIDTH TO 100% IT GOES OUT OF PARENT DIV AS IT HAS EXTRA BORDER AND PADDING.
NOW LET'S ASSUME PARENT WIDTH IS 500PX THEN INPUT WILL HAVE 500px if boxsizing is not boxborder but if it is boxborder then it will have 492.8
